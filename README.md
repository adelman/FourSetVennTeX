FourSetVennTeX
==============

An attempt to make a LaTeX package to deal with a four-set Venn Diagram.

The idea comes out of working on a logic problem set. The way it works is using
TikZ to overlay each individual piece. I hope to make parameters to make things
like \clip more intuitive for this diagram.
